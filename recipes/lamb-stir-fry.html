        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Heat a dry large cast-iron skillet over medium-high until beginning to smoke. Pour in 1 tbsp. vegetable oil, then add ground lamb and use a wooden spoon or heatproof spatula to press meat into a thin layer. Sprinkle with 1 tsp. salt, season with freshly ground black pepper, and scatter ginger over. Cook, undisturbed, until lamb is deeply browned underneath, about 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Break up meat into bite-size pieces, then add scallions, asparagus and dill. Season with salt and pepper. Cook, tossing often, until lamb is cooked through and asparagus is bright green and just crisp-tender, about 2 minutes (it’s okay if asparagus is still a little crunchy — it will continue to soften off the heat). Taste and add more salt and pepper if needed. Scatter finely grated zest of ½ lemon over.
            </li>
            <li>
                Divide stir-fry among bowls or plates and top with more dill. Serve with lemon wedges for squeezing over.
