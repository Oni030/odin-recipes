        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                In a 10-inch skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil over medium heat. Add the onions and peppers and season with salt. Cook for 4 to 5 minutes, stirring regularly until softened (being careful not to brown the onions).
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the tomatoes and tomato paste. Season with a little more salt, black pepper, oregano, and aleppo pepper. Cook for a few minutes over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes soften but still hold their shape (5 to 7 minutes).
            </li>
            <li>
                Push the tomato and pepper mixture to one side of the pan. Lower the heat to medium-low. Add the beaten egg, and cook briefly, stirring gently as needed, until the eggs are just set. Add grated kashkaval and fold the tomato mixture into the eggs and cheese.
            </li>
            <li>
                Finish with a little olive oil and aleppo pepper. Serve immediately with thick slices of bread.
